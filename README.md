Flash and configure the original Mars Hydro Bluetooth dongle to work with ESPHome.  
This project provides custom ESPHome YAML and instructions for controlling Mars Hydro lights locally via Home Assistant.

## Features
- Control Mars Hydro lights with ESPHome
- Works with the original Bluetooth dongle (requires flashing)

## Instructions

### 1. Disassemble the dongle
- There are 2 screws hidden behind the label on the back. Peel back the sticker to access them.
- Remove the screws to open the case.

### 2. Solder header pins
- Solder 6 header pins onto the exposed pads so you can connect Dupont cables.
- This will let you interface with a serial programmer.

### 3. Connect to a serial adapter
- Connect pin IO0 to GND before connecting to put the device iun download mode, remove after boot.
- Use an ESP-compatible USB-to-Serial adapter (for example: CH340 3.3V-5V TTL USB Serial Port Adapter).
- Make sure to use 3.3V for power and IO.
- **Wiring tip:** RXD on the adapter connects to TXD on the dongle, and TXD on the adapter connects to RXD on the dongle.
- Also connect GND and 3.3V appropriately.

### 4. Flash ESPHome
- Flash the provided ESPHome YAML file (found in this repository) using your preferred tool (esphome-flasher, ESPHome dashboard, etc.).
- Follow standard ESPHome flashing procedures.

### 5. Integrate with Home Assistant
- Once flashed, adopt the device in Home Assistant via ESPHome.
- You can then control your Mars Hydro lights locally without the cloud.
